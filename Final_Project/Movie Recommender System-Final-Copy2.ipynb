    "## Movie recommendations based on text from Wikipedia\n",

    "#### Background\n",
    "Movies recommendation is one of the classic application of recommendation systems, and there are several ways to achieve this. In this project, our goal is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the movie plot obtained from Wikipedia and determine relevant movies for a given movie. We scraped text related to 4037 movies from Wikipedia. These movies are American movies released since the year 2000. The key deliverables of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text corpus of 4037 movies\n",
    "* Movie posters of 3749 movies\n",
    "* Movie recommender based on movie's plot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technologies used:\n",
    "We used the following software/packages to develop the core logic of this project:\n",
    "* Python 3\n",
    "* Pandas\n",
    "* Numpy\n",
    "* Sklearn\n",
    "* BeautifulSoup\n",
    "* urllib\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** We scraped movie release posters to render the recommendations in a more aesthetic fashion. However, we could not get all the movies posters, since some of them are not available, and some of them were not easily downloadable (by our crawler) since the webpage's HTML IDs are not consistent."

    "We scraped the text related to movies from Wikipedia using a Python based web robot. The design of this web robot, along with the source code is present in *Appendix-A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection is divided into 2 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1:\n",
    "In the first phase, the web robot has successfully scraped the list of target movie URLs, by iteratively visiting the website  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_xxxx (where xxxx represent the year. For example, to obtain the list of American movies released in 2000, we have to visit the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_2000). From each URL the web robot has obtained the list of movie names, movie's Wiki page, cast, director and genre details. We scraped the list of movies for the years 2000-2016. A total of 4045 movies list was obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of phase-1 is a comma separated file (*Movie_Details.csv*), with the following details: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie** - Movie Name\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL** - Wikipedia web page for the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Year** - Year of release\n",
    "\n",
    "**Director** - Director of the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cast** - Cast of the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genre** - Movie's genre\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie_ID** - Unique key to distinguish each movie\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2:\n",
    "In the second phase, the web robot has visited all the 4045 URLs and has successfully downloaded the movie plots from Wikipedia. The web robot has run for approximately 7 hours to download 4037 movies text (we purposefully used a delay of 3 seconds between every hit, so that Wikipedia is not bombarded with continuous hits). Out of 4045 movies, we obtained text for 4037 movies, since 8 movies do not have any text in Wikipedia. Along with text, the web robot has also downloaded the relevant release posters for the movies. However, we were able to download 3749 posters, since the remaining posters were not found or not found by the web robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of phase-2 are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set of 3037 text files containing movie plots\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A set of 3749 movie posters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A comma separated file (*processed_data.csv*), with the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Movie_ID** - Unique identifier of the movie\n",
